Project: Transferify

# Project Description
Transfer students often come into UCLA at a disadvantage when it comes to information and networking. As transfers ourselves, we thought it could be helpful to have a mini-networking platform for transfers to get information about classes. Our application, Transferify is a one-stop resource where new transfers can figure out their future course plans. The application have several featuring functions such as:
* New users can create an account by inputting their email and a password.
* App can personalize user profile including name, year, major, and picture.
* Users who input their information will have this information saved on the back-end and retained for future use.
* User can organize planned courses with the information including prerequisites and difficulty.
* User can meaningfully search through server data on the directory page.

While our application is not planned to have a dedicated chat feature, there will be places to put contact information such as emails and social media usernames to encourage interaction.


# Commands to run Transferify locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\

Run the following commands:\
npm install --save-dev express cors\
npm install react-bootstrap-validation --save\
npm install react-router-dom --save\
npm install firebase
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
